# Multiples-Calculator

Allow the user to type in an integer and then output to the screen twelve multiples.  For example, if the user types in 3 the output should look like this:
For a = 3
The multiples are:  3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36
a. Be sure to use an appropriate looping structure to do this.
b. Implement the run again routine so the user can type in another integer and get new results.
c.  Turn in a single source ( .cpp ) file.
